# JackBot

A discord bot with miscellaneous features.
For more informations show our [Website](www.jackbot.pw).
If you want to steal my then just follow the setup. I recommend it for people who wants to test thigs out and if you are going to add new features to it and send a pull request.

### Setup

* Run `git clone git@github.com:Jacxk/JackBot.git` to clone the repository.
* After you cloned the repository, running `npm install` to install all required dependencies.  
* Then, copy or rename the config.example.json to config.json and add your configuration.  
* After you've done the configuration, run `node index.js` or `npm start` to start the bot.

### Note

You need a lot of api keys to get the bot working:
* Fortnite: https://fortnitetracker.com/site-api
* Google: https://console.developers.google.com/
* Hypixel: https://api.hypixel.net/

You also need a MySQL database.

The Readme is WIP (work in progress)!
